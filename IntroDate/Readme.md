Here is a revised summary of the ipynb code focusing on listing the functions:

Packages:
BenchmarkTools, DataFrames, DelimitedFiles, CSV, XLSX, Downloads, JLD, NPZ, RData, MAT 

Functions for reading and writing data:
- readdlm()  
- CSV.read()     
- XLSX.readdata()
- writedlm()
- CSV.write()   
- XLSX.writetable()
- download()
- JLD.load()
- save()  
- npzread()
- npzwrite()           
- RData.load()
- matread()
- matwrite()

Functions for processing data:
- findfirst()  
- findall()   
- dropmissing()
- describe()         
- innerjoin()  
- push!()              
- Base.splat()
- length()
- keys()       
- collect()
- map()
- @rput

Other functions:
- @show                  
- @btime

Functions are defined to:
- Look up data 
- Count data
- Group data
- Handle missing values

Data structures used:
- Matrix   
- DataFrame
- Dictionary

The code demonstrates:
- Loading data from various file types
- Storing data in different data structures   
- Functions to operate on that data
- Handling missing data

The finding is that Julia was created in 2012.

In summary, the code goes over the basics of loading, processing and storing data in Julia using various packages, functions and data structures as examples.

Hope this revised summary with a focus on listing the functions is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions or need me to expand on anything else.
